# The 5-Letter Word Game

A pass and play language game implemented as an app.

### Instructions for play:
- Both users will be selected to enter a 5 letter word. If unable to come up with a word, there is an option to chose from 5 randomly generated words. 
Once this is complete, play begins 
- The goal of the game is to guess your opponent's word in as few turns as possible. 
- Each turn, each player will be able to type in one 5 letter word. They will get back how many letters of the given word are present in the answer. 
(Ex if the answer is seven, and you entered snake, you would get a 3). 
- Users are able to annotate their keyboard by holding and dragging on a letter. 
- Once a player has input their word and recieved their letter count, both play and the keyboard automatically switch to the other player. 
- At any time, a play can swipe on the keyboard in order to switch from one player's keyboard to the other, as well as scroll up on the word list to view previously entered words.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
